   Automatically loads classes by name when called.  This saves resources, as  
   only pages that need to reference the class actually load it.
  
   The autoload function allows us to name a file after the class, and customize it to 
   meet our needs, but load the file requiring the class by assuming the file name based on 
   the name of the class.  In our case, we'll add '.php', which follows our pattern. 

  <code>
  $myObject = new myClass();
  </code>
    

   @param str $class_name Class to be loaded as needed
   @return void
